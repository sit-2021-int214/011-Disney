üí° Inside that dataset, contains information about the book, number of pages in the book, the book types, the book descriptions, and the book prices. This dataset is an easy-to-understand and relatively complete dataset with a total of 270 rows and 7 columns:

| No. | Column Name | Column Details | Data Type |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|1|Rating|Rating of the book|numeric|
|2|Reviews|Number of reviews on this book|numeric|
|3|Book_title|Name of the book|character| 
|4|Description|Description of the book|character| 
|5|Number_Of_Pages|Number of pages in the book|numeric|
|6|Type|The type of book (E.g. Hardcover, Kindle Edition, Paperback, etc.)|character| 
|7|Price|Average price of the book in USD|numeric| 

**Find the NA of each column.** There is no NA in the dataset.
```R
is.na(topbooks$Rating) %>% sum()
is.na(topbooks$Reviews) %>% sum()
is.na(topbooks$Book_title) %>% sum()
is.na(topbooks$Description) %>% sum()
is.na(topbooks$Number_Of_Pages) %>% sum()
is.na(topbooks$Type) %>% sum()
is.na(topbooks$Price) %>% sum()
```

üí° But this dataset has some minor modifications to the column type, the term "Boxed Set" should be omitted from "Boxed Set - Hardcover".

**Cleaning data column "Type" the word "Box set".**
```R
Books$Type <- Books$Type %>% str_remove("Boxed Set -") %>% str_trim()
View(Books)
```

## üìå Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2

### 1.) Graph show type of book
```R
# Bar Chart
ggplot(Books,aes(x = Type, fill = Type)) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Type of Book")
type_plot <- ggplot(Books,aes(x = Type, fill = Type)) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Type of Book") + coord_flip() + 
             xlab("Types") + ylab("Number of Books") + 
             scale_fill_manual(values = c("#eeb189", "#f9acc0", 
                                          "#d9debb", "#c4b3c3", "#86a5c4" ))
type_plot
```
Result:

![Graph 1-1](Image/Graph1-1.png)

```R
# Pie Chart
group_type <- data.frame(table(Books$Type))
group_type <- group_type %>% rename("Type" = Var1,"count" = Freq)

group_type %>% ggplot(aes(x = "",y = count, fill = Type)) + 
               geom_bar(stat ="identity", width = 1, color = "white") +
               coord_polar("y", start = 0)+
               theme_void() +
               geom_text(aes(label = percent(count/sum(count))),
               position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 4, color = "black") + 
               ggtitle("Type of Book") +
               scale_fill_manual(values = c("#eeb189", "#f9acc0", 
                                            "#d9debb", "#c4b3c3", "#86a5c4" ))
```
Result:

![Graph 1-2](Image/Graph1-2.png)

- You will see the bar chart graph by ggplot2. Doing :
  - create graph, adding point
  - add title
  - add theme and decoration
- There are 5 types of books in total and the most popular book type is paperback.

### 2.) Graph show relation between price and rating
```R
## Scatter Plot
Books %>% ggplot(aes(x = Rating,y = Price)) + geom_point()
ratingPrice_plot <- Books %>% ggplot(aes(x = Rating,y = Price)) + 
                    geom_point(aes(color=Type)) + ggtitle("Relation Between Price and Rating")
ratingPrice_plot
ratingPrice_plot + geom_smooth()
ratingPrice_plot + geom_smooth(method="lm") + theme_minimal() + 
                   theme(panel.grid = element_line(linetype = "dashed"))
```
Result:

![Graph 2](Image/Graph2.png)

Explain :

- You will see the scatter plot graph by ggplot2. Doing :
  - create graph, adding point
  - add title
  - add theme and decoration
- You can see that the data is scattered on the graph. Most of the information is at the bottom in the middle.
- Book prices have no relation to ratings.

### 3.) Graph show Rating of the book
```R
## Box Plot
rating_plot <- Books %>% ggplot(aes(x = Number_Of_Pages)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "#d54700") + 
               ggtitle("Number of Pages in the Book") + theme_light() 
rating_plot
```
Result:

![Graph 3](Image/Graph3.png)

Explain :

- You will see the box plot graph by ggplot2. Doing :
  - create graph, adding point
  - add title
  - add theme and decoration
- The data has a lot of variance. The average number of pages in a book is about 400 pages.
- There are 11 outliers above the upper limit.
